## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Declared estate / scope completeness.** A new opt-in
  `experimental.scope.required_sources` block in `.sigcomply.yaml` lets you
  declare the sources a project asserts coverage over. Any declared source that
  is not configured, not bound by a policy slot, or returns no records makes the
  run report `SCOPE INCOMPLETE` and exit `1`. This closes a false-green: because
  a policy with no configured source is skipped and skips leave the
  compliance-score denominator, forgetting to wire a platform previously *raised*
  your score instead of lowering it. Entirely opt-in — with no declaration there
  is no new output, no new exit code, and `summary.json` keeps its previous
  shape. The verdict is written to `summary.json` (covered by the run manifest
  signature) and never crosses the aggregation boundary.
- **`sigcomply report --view scope`.** Shows the declared estate and how each
  declared source fared, plus every control the latest run did *not* evaluate
  and why. The skip half renders even with no declaration — skipped controls
  leave the compliance score, so they are exactly what an all-green run hides.
- `check` now prints a short banner naming the sources it will collect from (and
  their region/backend) before making any API call, so it's clear the run reaches
  real infrastructure. Credentials are never printed.
- `check` surfaces a concise, actionable reason line under each failing or errored
  policy in the terminal summary (e.g. `manual evidence not found; expected files
  in: <path>`), instead of only writing it to the vault `result.json`.
- `sigcomply init` now scaffolds a `manual.pdf` evidence source (local `./evidence`
  backend) so a framework's manual-evidence controls bind and report `fail`
  ("evidence not found") rather than erroring out.

### Changed

- **A `pass_when` clause naming a slot the policy does not declare is now a
  load-time error.** Previously the slot lookup missed, yielded an empty record
  set, and `all`/`none` passed vacuously — one mistyped slot name silently turned
  a real check into a permanent green tick. Affects customer-authored policies
  under `.sigcomply/policies/` only; every shipped policy sets the slot name
  itself and cannot hit this.
- **Passes that examined no resource are now reported.** `all`/`none` are true of
  the empty set, so a clause whose slot is empty or whose filter matched nothing
  passes. That is often correct ("no public bucket is unencrypted" when none are
  public), so it is still a pass — but results now carry
  `diag.vacuous_clauses` and `check` explains such a pass inline. Previously
  `resources_evaluated` reported the *pre-filter* population, so a policy that
  filtered 500 records to zero rendered as "all 500 resources passed".
- CI examples and `init-ci` templates now default `SIGCOMPLY_VERSION` to a pinned
  release tag instead of `latest`, so a new release can't auto-propagate to every
  tester's next CI run. Set it to `latest` to opt back into always-newest.
- Error output no longer dumps the full command usage/flags block after a runtime
  error; the one-line message is shown on its own (`SilenceUsage`).

### Fixed

- A fresh `sigcomply init -f <framework> && sigcomply check` now exits `1`
  (findings to remediate), not `2`, and prints zero `[error]` lines.
- `init-ci` with a missing required `--ci` flag now exits `3` (configuration error)
  to match the exit-code taxonomy, instead of cobra's default `2`.
- `--cloud` with no `cloud.base_url` (or `--cloud-url`) configured now warns that
  submission was skipped, instead of silently doing nothing.
- Malformed-YAML config errors now include a plain-language hint (indentation,
  tabs, unknown keys) alongside the raw parser message.
